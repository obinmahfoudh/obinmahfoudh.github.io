        Description: `This course is an introduction to the computer science major, covering basic concepts using an object-oriented(OO) programming language.
                      The course addresses the following questions:
        
                      What is an algorithm?
                  
                      How does one write, debug, run (“execute”), and test an effective computer program?
                  
                      How does one convert an algorithm into a computer program?
                  
                      How does one judge a program?
